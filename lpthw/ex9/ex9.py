days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun" #This is just a regular viarable with a string.
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"# This variable string has a line break function to separate the months in new lines

print("Here are the days: ", days)# Standard print function with the added variable (line3)
print("Here are the months: ", months)# Standard print function with the added variable (line4)
